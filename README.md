development history

O2o, or online to offline, refers to the combination of offline business opportunities and the Internet to make the Internet the front desk for offline transactions. This concept originated in the United States. The concept of o2o is very extensive. As long as the industrial chain can involve both online and offline, it can be called o2o.

O2o e-commerce model needs to have five elements: independent online shopping mall, national authoritative industry trusted website certification, online advertising marketing, comprehensive social media and customer online interaction, online and offline integrated member marketing system.

One view is that an enterprise can have both online store and offline store, and the price of online store and offline store is the same, which can be called o2o; another view is that o2o is a special form of B2C (business to customers).

In the early stage of 1.0, o2o was initially connected online and offline, mainly by using the convenience of online promotion to gather relevant users, and then the online traffic was reversed to offline. The main fields were online group buying and promotion represented by meituan. In this process, there are mainly unidirectional and low viscosity characteristics. The interaction between the platform and users is less, and the completion of the transaction is basically the end point. Users are driven by price and other factors, and the purchase and consumption frequency are relatively low.

After the development to 2.0, o2o basically has the elements that are understood by everyone at present. The main feature of this stage is to upgrade to a service-oriented e-commerce mode: including goods (services), order, payment and other processes, and transfer the previous simple e-commerce module to a more high-frequency and living scenario. As the traditional service industry has been in a state of low efficiency and insufficient labor digestion, under the promotion of new mode and the catalysis of capital, o2o Carnival boom has appeared, so door-to-door massage, door-to-door delivery, door-to-door fresh food, door-to-door makeup, Didi taxi and other o2o models began to emerge in endlessly. In this stage, due to the maturity of mobile terminal, wechat payment, data algorithm and other links, coupled with the catalysis of capital, users have a blowout, the use frequency and loyalty began to rise, o2o began to integrate with users' daily life, becoming an integral part of life. But in the middle there are many seemingly prosperous needs, because of the huge subsidies of the capital, the false bubbles cover up the real situation. There are many business models that are not rigid demand, such as massage, car washing and so on.

At the 3.0 stage, the obvious differentiation began. One is that some companies in the real vertical segmentation field began to emerge. For example, we focus on express logistics, high-end restaurants and fast food pick-up. The other is the development of platform mode in vertical subdivision field. From the original subdivision of the field to solve a pain point mode began to expand horizontally, covering the entire industry.

For example, hungry? From the early takeout to the later open hummingbird system, it began to officially connect with the third-party team and crowdsourcing logistics. Take franchisee as the main body, self-supporting distribution as the template and operation center, and solve the long tail order through crowdsourcing cooperation. The distribution category includes fresh food, supermarket products, and even laundry services, so as to realize platform operation [1]

On June 8, 2013, the online and offline price of Suning line was the same, which opened the prologue of o2o mode.

core technology

The core of o2o marketing mode is online payment.

This is not only because online services can't be packed and delivered, but also because express itself can't deliver the happiness brought by social experience. But if we can display offline goods and services through o2o mode, and provide online payment "booking consumption", for consumers, it not only widens the choice, but also selects the most expected services through online comparison, and enjoys more suitable services provided by businesses according to the regional nature of consumers. But if there is no online display, it may be difficult for consumers to know the business information, let alone consumption. In addition, merchants who are currently using o2o to explore their way forward often use more favorable means than offline payment to attract customers to pay online, which also saves consumers a lot of expenses.

On the surface, the key of o2o seems to be the information release on the network, because only the Internet can spread the information of merchants faster, farther and wider, and gather powerful consumption capacity in an instant. But in fact, the core of o2o is online payment.

Applied value

The advantage of o2o lies in the perfect combination of online and offline advantages. Through the online shopping guide machine, the Internet is perfectly connected with the ground store to realize the landing of the Internet. Let consumers enjoy the online preferential price, but also enjoy the offline intimate service. At the same time, o2o mode can also realize the alliance of different businesses.

1. The o2o model makes full use of the advantages of the Internet in terms of cross region, boundless, massive information and massive users, and at the same time fully exploits offline resources, thus facilitating the transaction between online users and offline goods and services. Group buying is a typical representative of o2o.

2. O2o model can conduct intuitive statistics and tracking evaluation on the marketing effect of merchants, avoiding the unpredictability of the promotion effect of traditional marketing model. O2o combines online orders and offline consumption, and all consumption behaviors can be accurately counted, so as to attract more merchants and provide more high-quality products and services for consumers.
